# 💰 Flutter Expense Tracker

This is my first project in flutter and it is
a modern, and clean, expense tracking application built with Flutter. This app helps users track their daily spending, categorize expenses, and visualize their financial habits with interactive charts.

## ✨ Features

* **Transaction Management:** Add, Edit, and Delete expenses easily.
    * *Swipe Left* to Delete.
    * *Swipe Right* to Edit.
* **Visual Analytics:** A dynamic Pie Chart that updates based on your spending.
* **Filtering:**
    * Navigate through months.
    * Filter by specific categories (e.g., see only "Food" expenses).
* **Persistent Storage:** Data is saved locally on the device using SQLite, so it's never lost.
* **Dark Mode:** Fully supported Dark/Light theme toggle (Quite unessesary but whatever).
